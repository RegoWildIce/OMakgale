 <h1>My saturday</h1>
<p>My day was not not interesting at all but it was quiet hectic. I woke up early in the morning to prepare myself to go to the Kutlwanong program meeting for grade 10.I woke up very early because i did not want to miss the bus.The meeting started at 8am and end at 12pm. I was very tired,so i came back home and unwore my school my school uniform then went to Kanana "Matalaneng".I went to Matalaneng with my parents to check up on my granny because she was unwell.We started at Kanana till around 10pm at that time i was very very exhausted.Then i told my parents that we should come back home because i had to prepare myself for school.When we arrived at home i had to iron and prepare my books.And doing everything i did not hesitate,i went to sleep.That`s how my saturday went like,boring and hectic ,nothing good about it</p>
